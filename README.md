2: Professional Portfolio

## Overview

Hi! I am Amy Wilhoite and this is my professional portfolio I've created to display my work product.
<BR>
My goals in this project are to deploy new skills while keeping in mind the user story of my future employer:
<BR>
* flexbox
* media queries 
* CSS variables 

This work contains:
* my previous work
* my contact info, a recent  or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work
* nav links correlate to corresponding sections
* images link to corresponding work
* responsive layout
